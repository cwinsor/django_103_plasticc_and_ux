    <h1>Building The Model</h1>

    <p>
        PLAsTiCC is a timeseries dataset.  Here's the process to create a model:
        <li>
        Preprocessing establishes cleans up the data and establishes base attributes.
        <li>
        Feature Engineering is the task of creating features.
        Thousands of features (mostly hand-crafted) are common in PLAsTiCC submissions.
        <li>
        Feature Engineering eliminates the time domain, replaced by reduction features (think of "period" replacing a series of amplitudes).
        <li>
        A metric measures the model's performance. Metrics need to be established up front!
    </p>
    <p>
         Google's Tensorflow provides the framework.
