• object id: the Object ID, unique identifier (given as int32 numbers).
• ra: right ascension, sky coordinate: longitude, units are degrees (given as float32
numbers).
• decl: declination, sky coordinate: latitude, units are degrees (given as float32 numbers).
• gal l: Galactic longitude, units are degrees (given as float32 numbers).
• gal b: Galactic lattitude, units are degrees (given as float32 numbers).
• ddf: A Boolean flag to identify the object as coming from the DDF survey area (with
value ddf = 1 for the DDF). Note that while the DDF fields are contained within the
full WFD survey area, the DDF fields have significantly smaller uncertainties, given
that the data are provided as additions of all observations in a given night.

• hostgal specz: the spectroscopic redshift of the source
. This is an extremely accurate measure of redshift, provided for the training set and a small fraction of the
test set (given as float32 numbers).
• hostgal photoz: The photometric redshift of the host galaxy of the astronomical
source. While this is meant to be a proxy for hostgal specz, there can be large
differences between the two and hostgal photoz should be regarded as a far less
accurate version of hostgal specz. The hostgal photoz is given as float32 numbers.
• hostgal photoz err: The uncertainty on the hostgal photoz based on LSST survey projections, given as float32 numbers.
• distmod: The distance (modulus) calculated from the hostgal photoz since this
redshift is given for all objects (given as float32 numbers). Computing the distance
modulus requires knowledge of General Relativity, and assumed values of the dark
energy and dark matter content of the Universe, as mentioned in the introduction
section.
• MWEBV = MW E(B-V): this ‘extinction’ of light is a property of the Milky Way (MW)
dust along the line of sight to the astronomical source, and is thus a function of
the sky coordinates of the source ra, decl. This is used to determine a passband
dependent dimming and reddening of light from astronomical sources as described
in subsection 2.1, and is given as float32 numbers.
• target: The class of the astronomical source. This is provided in the training data.
Correctly determining the target (correctly assigning classification probabilities to
the objects) is the goal of the classification challenge for the test data. The target
is given as int8 numbers.

Light-curve data:
<br>
• object id: Same key as in the metadata table above, given as int32 numbers.
• mjd: the time in Modified Julian Date (MJD) of the observation. The MJD is a unit
of time introduced by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in 1957 to record
the orbit of Sputnik. The MJD is defined to have a starting point of midnight on
November 17, 1858. The 25th of September 2018 has an MJD of 58386. The MJD can
be converted to Unix epoch time with the formula unix time = (MJD40587)86400.
The units are days, and the numbers are given as float64 numbers.
• passband: The specific LSST passband integer, such that u, g, r, i, z, y = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
in which it was viewed. These are given as int8 numbers.
• flux: the measured flux (brightness) in the passband of observation as listed in the
passband column. The flux is corrected for MWEBV, but for large dust extinctions the
uncertainty will be much larger in spite of the correction. The dust is given as a
float32 number (note that the units for both flux and flux err are arbitrary).
• flux err: the uncertainty on the measurement of the flux listed above, given as
float32 number.
• detected: If detected= 1, the object’s brightness is significantly different at the 3σ
level relative to the reference template. This is given as a Boolean flag.
